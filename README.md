# WorkingWithArrays

I used C# ranges and arrays to analyze the length of episodes from the Simpsons universe. I need to hardcode more season data.

The data for this assignment should be hardcoded as an array of tuples, where each tuple represents an episode and contains the following elements:
- Season number (int)
- Episode number (int)
- Title (string)
- Length (int, in minutes)

The program performs the following tasks:

- Parse the data to extract the length of each episode, and group the episodes by season (WIP needs more data hardcoded)
- Calculate the average length of each season (Working)
- Display the top three longest seasons of Simpsons (Working)
